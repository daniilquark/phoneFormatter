# phoneFormatter
This program will quickly bring a phone number from any format to one that can be selected with a double click.
Usually phone numbers come to us from users with a lot of extra characters and in different display format.

Example:

+7 999 999-99-99
+7 (999) 999 - 99 - 99
+7 - (999) - 999 - 9999
8 999 999 99 99
999 999 9999
etc.

Bottom line:

79999999999
